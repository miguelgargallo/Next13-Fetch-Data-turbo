I want to pay by credit card, is there an option?

Yes, PayPal is set it up, and HNS, it is also full decentralized, by the moment.

Can I get a refund on my account, credit card or HNS Wallet?

No. We do not accept refunds of any kind.

Can I use multi-factor authentication to add security to my pencil.domains account?

In fact, you must. Yes, there is an option to turn DUO or Google Auth on for your account by editing your account details.

I don't think GA or DUO worked because I wasn't asked for it when logging in.

If you enter the correct code from a computer, for convenience we store a cookie there so you don't have to enter the code each time you log in. If you'd rather enter the code each time, simply make sure to log out of pencil.domains and the cookie will be deleted.

What happens if I lost DUO or Google Auth?

Go to Twitter Official account for support.

No, by the moment we do not transfer domains to other registrars.

Can I push my domain to another pencil.domains user? What is the fee?

Yes - on the Domain details page, simply click on the button labeled "Push" and enter the email address of the person you want to push the domain to. They will have to create a pencil.domains account if they do not already have one. There is a fee of 50 HNS to push a domain.
