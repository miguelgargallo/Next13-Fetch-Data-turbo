            </p>
            <p>
              Pencil Domains is a project of Pencil Works LLC. We also started
              Pencil Website years, ago. pencil.domains allows you to rent
              domains on new TLDs which have been created with the
              <a href="https://handshake.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                handshake project
              </a>
              . It is an improved version of DNS built for the new internet.

                What are handshake domains and how do I resolve them in my
                browser?

            </p>
            <p>
              Handshake is DNS built on a blockchain. It is outside of ICANN.
              You can resolve handshake domains with
              <a href="https://nextdns.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                NextDNS

                EPP
              </a>
              is the standard protocol used for the provisioning and management
              of Internet domain names. It is used to manage most of the domains
              on the internet including all .com domains, .org domains, .io
              domains, etc... We are the first to rent Spain, Canarias, Andorra
              domains to use EPP to manage and sell domains on handshake TLDs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Is the TLD secure?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The TLDs are secured on the handshake blockchain. We use advanced
              tools like Bob Wallet to secure domains.

                I do not think GA or DUO worked because I was not asked for it

              Yes - on the Domain details page, simply click on the button

              push the domain to. They will have to create a pencil.domains
